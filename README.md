# Exposing the Shady Tactics of DPS Bokaro (expose-dpsbokaro.github.io)

## Introduction
I am Kabido789, a vigilante working under the 789 cult, dedicated to exposing the unethical practices of DPS Bokaro and its principal, Dr. A.S. Gawar. This GitHub Repository is a .md dump that will soon become a website. It aims to provide students, parents, and the public with a comprehensive understanding of the shady tactics employed by this institution.

## Questionable Admission Practices
DPS Bokaro is known to engage in dubious admission practices, favoring students from influential families or those willing to pay exorbitant fees. The admission process often lacks transparency, with allegations of nepotism and bribery. Powered by the one and only, A. S. Gangwar

## Exploitative Fee Structure
The school's fee structure is designed to be financially burdensome for many families. Exorbitant tuition fees, coupled with hidden charges and mandatory donations, make it challenging for middle-class and underprivileged students to access quality education.

## Substandard Facilities and Resources
Despite the high fees, the school's facilities and resources often fall short of expectations. Classrooms are overcrowded, and essential amenities like well-equipped laboratories and libraries are lacking or are just for show.

## Unethical Treatment of Teachers
DPS Bokaro is known to exploit its teaching staff, offering low salaries, poor working conditions, and limited opportunities for professional development. This leads to high teacher turnover and compromises the quality of education.

## Suppression of Student Voices
The school administration is accused of silencing student voices and discouraging them from voicing their concerns or grievances. This creates an environment of fear and discourages critical thinking.

## Conclusion
The 789 cult, of which I am a part, is committed to exposing the shady tactics of DPS Bokaro and its principal, Dr. A.S. Gawar. We urge students, parents, and the community to be vigilant and demand transparency and accountability from this institution. Together, we can work towards creating a
more equitable and ethical educational system.
