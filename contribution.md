### dps bokaro, is a big organization, with a turnover of multiple crores.
##### these organization generally tend to control the law-enforcement agencies. these enforcement agencies track everything. from your IP address to your mobile numbers, from your Aadhar Card information, to every single bit of information you've shared over to your friends and families, they know it all.
###### in such cases, you need to be swift and avoid such agencies, they are not doing anything better for us, the oppressed. they rather prefer doing favors for these corporates on whose money they feed.

### for this following reason, i request you to follow the following procedure before any contribution, for your own safety
