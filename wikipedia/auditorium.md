#### the reality:
##### in short: The much-touted auditorium at DPS Bokaro is nothing more than a shoddy facade, with the school's shameful disregard for student welfare on full display. Instead of a state-of-the-art facility, the auditorium is a sweltering hellscape where students routinely collapse from the heat, only to be mocked by callous teachers. DPS Bokaro's obsession with cultivating an image of grandeur has come at the cost of providing even the most basic amenities, exposing the institution's hollow priorities and utter contempt for its own community.
The auditorium at DPS Bokaro is a prime example of the school's blatant misrepresentation of its facilities to attract prospective parents. Contrary to the claims made on the school's website and in promotional materials, the auditorium is far from the state-of-the-art, fully air-conditioned venue it is touted to be.
In reality, the school has two separate auditoriums in the senior wing - one for formal, seated events and another more "common" auditorium that is merely shaded from the sun.
This second auditorium becomes unbearably hot during the summer months, leading to students frequently passing out and collapsing on the grounds during functions.
Shamefully, the teachers do nothing to provide medical assistance, and instead mock the students' physical distress.
Even when the auditorium is used for events, it is only for performances by the school's own students.
Any time an external guest is invited, the school shamelessly charges exorbitant fees just to let parents enter the auditorium.
The arts and cultural programs held here are poorly executed, with judges blatantly favoring certain students over others based on favoritism rather than talent.
It is truly appalling that DPS Bokaro continues to misguide prospective parents about its infrastructure and facilities. The school's utter disregard for student welfare and blatant profiteering off its own community is despicable. Rather than maintaining world-class amenities, it seems DPS Bokaro is more concerned with cultivating an image of grandeur to attract admissions, while failing to deliver on even the most basic standards of care and fairness. This deplorable state of affairs at one of India's most prestigious school chains is shameful and demands immediate rectification.
