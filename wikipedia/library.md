##### in short: The DPS Bokaro library is a poorly managed and neglected facility, with limited student access, outdated book collections, and punitive measures that exploit students and parents. The school's claims of a well-furnished library are nothing more than empty rhetoric, as the reality paints a bleak picture of an institution that prioritizes financial gain over the intellectual growth of its students.

The DPS Bokaro school administration makes grandiose claims about the quality and accessibility of their library facilities, but the reality paints a far more dismal picture. Contrary to their boastful assertions, the library is woefully mismanaged, with a severe lack of relevant and up-to-date reading materials for the students.

Despite the school's proclamations of the library being available to students during school hours, the truth is that access is severely limited, with the facility only open to students below Class 11 once a week. This severely curtails the educational opportunities and intellectual growth of the majority of the student body. Moreover, the book collection is alarmingly outdated and irrelevant, failing to cater to the diverse academic and personal interests of the students. The school's negligence in maintaining a comprehensive and contemporary library is a disservice to the very individuals it claims to educate and empower.

The library's management is equally abysmal, with librarians often denying students the ability to borrow books. This heavy-handed approach stifles the students' thirst for knowledge and their ability to engage in self-directed learning. Furthermore, the school's punitive measures regarding book returns are nothing short of extortionate. Students who fail to return books on the due date are subjected to exorbitant fines, amounting to four times the original price of the book. This predatory practice is a blatant attempt to extract money from the parents, rather than fostering a culture of responsible book stewardship.

The deplorable state of the library's book collection is a testament to the school's utter disregard for the educational well-being of its students. Books are left to degrade, with no apparent effort made to maintain or replace them. This negligence is a clear indication that the library is merely a facade, a hollow representation of the school's commitment to providing a comprehensive and enriching learning environment. **In conclusion, the DPS Bokaro library is a glaring example of the school's failure to prioritize the intellectual and academic development of its students. The restricted access, outdated collections, mismanagement, and punitive measures are a damning indictment of the school's priorities, which seem to be more focused on financial gain than on fostering a culture of learning and exploration.**
