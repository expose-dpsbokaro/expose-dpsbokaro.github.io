``` less number of boys toilet and their condition
the school has 53 girl toilets and 37 boy toilets for about 3700 kids. amounting to about 40 kids/washroom, which is not a bad metric, but
although the school shares a relative alright gender-ratio of 51:49 or 1:1, the amount of boy toilets are really less.
the boy toilets are in generally bad condition with piss all over the floor, most of the time the number 2 is not flushed, cleanliness and sanitation services are below average here.
boy toilets are mostly broken. students are greeted oftentimes with scribbled walls
please dont send your child to DPS because of the toilets, they suck

better versions to be available, soon.
