``` raw-pw:no information given to parents about PTA or SMC
DPS Bokaro doesn't inform Parents about the Parents Teacher Association. Infact both the parents representative of class 11 were from outside bokaro, and even outside the state of Jhakhand.
Mr. Niraj Kumar Singh lives in Aurangabad and Mr. Krishna Mehta lives in Vishakhapatnam and are Parent Representatives and supposed to represent the problems of the parents.

# Lack of Transparency in Parent-Teacher Associations at DPS Bokaro Raises Concerns

### **DPS Bokaro Very clearly misleads people by re-naming Parents' Teachers' Conference as PTA, but according to [ncpcr.gov.in](https://ncpcr.gov.in/uploads/167663015963ef588f17bd5_165599572062b47d48d80d2_standard-operating-proceduressop-for-implementation-of-section-121c-of-the-rte-act-2009--model-procedures-for-effective-implementation.pdf), PTA stands for Parents-Teachers associations, and are special committies in which parents' represntatives overlook the developments in schools and represent the parents.
Parents of students enrolled at DPS Bokaro, a prominent school in the city, have raised concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding the school’s Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) and School Management Committee (SMC).

According to sources, parents are kept in the dark about the PTA’s existence and its activities. This year, it came to light that the two parent representatives for Class 11, Mr. Niraj Kumar Singh and Mr. Krishna Mehta, reside outside Jharkhand – in Aurangabad and Vishakhapatnam respectively. This raises questions about their ability to effectively represent the concerns of local parents. Critics allege that these appointments are made based on the individuals’ connections with the school’s administration, rather than their accessibility to the parents they are supposed to represent.

Furthermore, the school reportedly fails to provide any contact information for the parent representatives within the PTA. This lack of transparency makes it difficult, if not impossible, for parents to reach out to their designated representatives with issues or concerns.

Similar concerns plague the SMC. Parents allege a complete lack of information regarding the SMC, including its composition and function. There seems to be no designated channel for parents to connect with the SMC representatives, hindering any potential collaboration or coordination.
