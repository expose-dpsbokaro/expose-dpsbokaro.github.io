# the fire safety
the fire safety certificate expired on 30/11/2023
no fire training was provided to the students, no evacuation drill was held. they don't really care about student's safety
# less area in classrooms
on average a person requires around 1 m square to sit, but each classroom has around 49 m square. each classroom holds around 45 students. not living the classsroom with enough space. spacious classrooms in dps bokaro are a joke.
