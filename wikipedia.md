the school boasts about having a well furnished library with books, but there is no truth to it. it is said to be available to the students during school hours but it is only once a week for students below class 11;
no good books are available. most books are outdated and irrelevant, actual good books are always lent out, or actually never really there. the school takes fine if the book isnt returned on the due date
the books are degrading and no one cares, its just another piece of infrastructure by which the school can steal money from the parents.
if ever, a book is allegedly damaged by the student, the student has to pay 4x the price, quite literally, the library runs on student that actually damage the books.
it is very shameful
